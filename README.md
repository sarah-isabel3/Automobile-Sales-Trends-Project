# 🚗 Automobile Data Analytics Project
**Python-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## 📘 Project Overview
This project performs comprehensive analysis on a diverse automobile dataset. It uncovers insights about fuel efficiency, performance, safety, comfort features, alert mechanisms, and vehicle dimensions. The findings support market understanding, product development, and consumer decisions.

### Project Parts:
- **Part 1:** Performance & Efficiency Analysis
- **Part 2:** Safety, Comfort & Dimensional Analysis

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze car performance (displacement, cylinders, valves).
- Identify city and highway mileage influencers.
- Assess safety systems (ABS, airbags, hill-assist).
- Evaluate comfort (seating, child safety).
- Examine alert systems (seatbelt, speed alerts).
- Conduct size/dimension analysis for market planning.
- Summarize trends and actionable conclusions.

## 🧩 Part 1 – Performance & Efficiency Analysis

**Tasks & Insights:**
- **Performance Comparison**
   - Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation for displacement, cylinders, valves.
   - **Findings:** Luxury brands (Aston Martin, Bentley, BMW) show higher displacement/cylinders. Economy brands (Bajaj, Audi) favor efficiency.
   - Boxplots display high variability among premium brands—diverse engine offerings.
- **Mileage Correlation Analysis**
   - Top factors negatively correlated with mileage: power, displacement, kerb weight, torque, fuel tank capacity.
   - **Conclusion:** Larger engines and heavier vehicles have lower city/highway mileage.
   - Visuals: Heatmaps/scatterplots highlight negative relationships for brands like Toyota, Honda, Renault.

## 🧩 Part 2 – Safety, Comfort & Dimensional Analysis

**Tasks & Insights:**
- **Safety Feature Assessment**
   - Audi, Jeep, Mahindra, BMW lead on safety.
   - Brands like Aston Martin, Bugatti, Mitsubishi lag due to limited safety data.
- **Comfort Analysis**
   - Seating Capacity: ICML, Land Rover, Mitsubishi highest; Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti lowest.
   - Central locking/child safety best in Hyundai, Honda, Maruti Suzuki, Tata.
   - Sports cars lack family features.
- **Alert System Analysis**
   - Hyundai, Toyota, BMW top the list for comprehensive alert systems.
   - Standardization of alerts in compact SUVs/sedans.
- **Dimensional Analysis**
   - Ford models largest on average.
   - BMW models compact/performance-focused.

## 📝 Final Business Conclusions

- **Fuel Efficiency:** Driven by displacement, power, weight, torque. Compact cars excel in cities.
- **Safety:** Premium/modern brands strongest.
- **Comfort Features:** Dominate in Indian mass-market brands.
- **Sports Cars:** Trade comfort/safety for performance/design.
- **Alerts:** Standard in modern vehicles—boost safety perception.
- **Dimension Trends:** Preference for larger compact SUVs.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- Missing/data Not Available records affect brand-level analysis.
- Diverse units/formats required extensive data cleaning.
- Few models per brand can skew statistics.
- Feature name variations needed manual normalization.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Extend analysis to **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**.
- Build **predictive models** (mileage, price, safety score).
- Integrate more datasets (crash ratings, CO₂ emissions, drivetrain type).
- Deploy interactive dashboards (**Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit**).
